In a land where the wild shadows play,
Under the opaline moon’s tender sway,
There danced the fearsome Jabberwocky,
Keeper of the enchanted forest’s entry.

With eyes of fire and wings of night,
It stirred the stars to soft twilight,
Its talons sharp as the shards of dreams,
Slicing through the silence with eerie screams.

Its scales shimmered with ethereal glow,
In the magical woods where time moved slow,
And though its form might terror inspire,
It watched o’er realms far from the common mire.

From the twisted branches, the creature’s call
Wove through the trees, a haunting thrall,
In verses cryptic, an ancient song,
Of kingdoms lost and legends long.

Yet brave hearts ventured, seeking its grace,
For in its presence, fears embrace,
The whispered truth beneath the lore,
That beauty thrives in the beast’s core.

So dance, O fearsome Jabberwocky,
In your moonlit realm of fantasy,
For though your visage might dismay,
Your spirit guards the night and day.
