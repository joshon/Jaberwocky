'Twas brillig and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the land of Jaberwocky,
All mimsy were the borogroves
And the mome raths outgrabe.

"Beware the Jaberwocky, my dear!
He'll leave you in a state of fear.
His eyes are bright, his claws are sharp,
He'll leave you in a state of scar.

He'll chortle and he'll whifflify,
He'll gore and he'll masticate.
He'll leave you in a state of fright,
So beware, my dear, the Jaberwocky's might!"

The one who spoke these words of warning,
Was a wise old man, a sage, a scholar.
He knew of the Jaberwocky's power,
And sought to save us from his hour.

But alas, his words fell on deaf ears,
For we were curious, we had no fears.
We ventured deep into the Jaberwocky's lair,
And faced the beast, with no care.

His claws were sharp, his breath was foul,
His eyes were bright, his roar was loud.
He chortled and whifflified, he gored and masticated,
And left us in a state of fright, so dreadful and so sad.

So heed the warning, dear reader,
And beware the Jaberwocky's might.
For though he may be a fearsome sight,
He'll leave you in a state of fright, oh so dreadful and so bright.
