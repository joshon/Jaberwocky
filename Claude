Here's a poem inspired by the famous nonsense poem "Jabberwocky" by Lewis Carroll:

The Jabbering Jaberwock

'Twas brillig in the tulgey woods,
The uffish things were whelmed.
Beware the frumious Jaberwock!
Its jaws were fiercely gelmed.

The vorpal blade went snicker-snack,
To slay the manxome foe.
We chortled at the outgrabe act,
While mimsy bourgouns did go.

Beware the jubjub bird's shrill cry,
The frumious Bandersnatch!
They whiffled through the murky sky,
With claws outstretched to catch.

One, two! The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
He left it dead, and with its head
He went galrumphing back.

"And hast thou slain the Jaberwock?
Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!"
He chortled in his joy.

'Twas brillig in the tulgey woods,
The uffish things were whelmed.
And through the waves of Brilligoggle
The mimsy bourgouns outmelmed.
