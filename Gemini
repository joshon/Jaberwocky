In forests deep, where shadows creep,
A terror lurks, a nightmare steep.
The Jabberwocky, eyes ablaze,
With teeth that gnash and claws that daze.

Its hide like thunder, storms a-brewing,
Across the moors its form pursuing.
A fearsome beast, with snicker-snack,
It sends the Jubjub bird aback.

Through twisted trees, the Bandersnatch,
With frumious grin, it plots to snatch.
The mimsy borogoves all flee,
From Jabberwocky's hungry spree.

But fear not, hero, bold and strong,
With vorpal blade to right the wrong.
Through wabe and pool, with courage true,
To face the beast, the battle due.

The clash of steel, a mighty fight,
The Jabberwocky takes its flight.
With valiant heart and lightning blow,
The hero lays the monster low.

So sleeps the beast, a fearsome dream,
And joyous cheers, a sunlit gleam.
The land is safe, the danger past,
The Jabberwocky's reign won't last.
