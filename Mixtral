In the midst of Tulgey Wood,
A fearsome creature stirred,
Its jaws unhinged, its eyes ablaze,
A Jabberwocky emerged.

With scales and claws and sharpened teeth,
It stalked its prey with stealth,
Its mighty wings beat thunderous,
A beast of great wealth.

It slithered through the underbrush,
Its tail a deadly whip,
As heroes trembled in its wake,
It readied for a fight.

But brave the champion was,
And with a mighty stroke,
The Jabberwocky fell, defeated,
A legend, now broke.

Its tale is told through ages past,
A monster, fierce and wild,
But in the end, the Jabberwocky,
Was slain by a child.
